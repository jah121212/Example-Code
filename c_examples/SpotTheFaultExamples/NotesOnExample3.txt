/* My notes:
 * C is considered to be a language in which 'white space' has no impact.
 * 'd = a/*c' is invalid but 'd = a/ *c' is valid C, in the first case '/*' is the start of a comment,
 * when what we are really trying to do is divide by a dereferenced pointer.
 * Are there any other example you can think of in which white space is important?
