/*
 * My notes:
 * function1 returns a pointer to a locally defined array.
 * function2 returns a pointer to a static array, code is non-reenterant, how could this be resolved?
 *     Talk about mutex/semaphore, could the array be passed in.
 * main *(ptr + 10) out of range.
 * Code compiles but returns a warning 'function retruns address of local variable', seg fault at execution
